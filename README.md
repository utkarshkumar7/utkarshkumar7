I'm highly interested in associate product management roles and hardware engineering roles. I aim to work in a dynamic fast-paced environment which suits my driven attitude. I'm currently looking for an entry-level job and I have high-voltage equipment and electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) experience as an intern. I am a hard worker with a passion for learning the "why" behind the "what." In any workplace that I am a part of I aspire to lead people, manage and oversee tasks, and help scale projects to align with the company's strategies and values.
